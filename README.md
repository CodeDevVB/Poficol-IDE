# Poficol-IDE
An App to revoulutionize the VB.NET language! An IDE.

* Note : This app is currently on Alpha & Beta Stage so changes will drastically change!

> This app is basically an IDE which is pure VB.NET based and will contain a language that will be called "Zopic#"!
Also this app will be the first perfect IDE that will be made on Visual Studio, VB.NET as this language is pretty less-popular so this may be a discovery!

**You may goto the Releases of this repository to access the app!**
Only for desktop with Windows Vista and later! Supporting .exe files(which is common) and also contain .NET Framework 4.7!
Also this project is open-source so it's completely free to edit and make it on your own way!
Thanks for reading!
